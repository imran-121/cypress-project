# cypress-project

1) In this project I have automated the 5 login test cases for the website http://automationpractice.com/index.php
2) We have used data driven approach here, like fixture folder contains the json files for user, if you just add more data rows then number of test cases will increase proportionally
3) Utilized page object model appraoch with the help of core javascript and mocha libarary
4) Page folder contains classes for page objects
5) e2e folder contains feature files, form where test executions are initiated
